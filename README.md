# uca-senior-year
This repository stores all my homework, assignments, and projects from my senior year at the University of Central Asia (UCA). It includes code, documentation, and resources, organized by course and assignment. The goal is to maintain a structured record of my academic work, showcasing my progress and skills throughout the year.
